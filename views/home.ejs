		This is my private little homepage. This is where I keep my projects. Most of them is done with the the inspiration of two
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> channels. One is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">The Coding Train</a> and the other
		one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath">Coding Math</a>. Oh, and the Super Mario thing is from
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ">Meth Meth Method</a> which I've tried to enhance and the Rubiks Cube&trade; is
		from <a href="http://iamthecu.be/">Rubiks Cube Explorer</a>. Most of the project aren't completed, a thing I for some reason have trouble with,
    even in real life. I have so many projects at home which isn't completed either...

    This is by the way running Node.js on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3</a>
    located in my home. It's a wonderful cheap little device acting as a webserver which can actually do a lot of things. I might also
    start a new hardware project soon. I've been checking out the <a href="https://magicmirror.builders/">Magic Mirror</a>
		and it looks amazing, but I don't have a spare monitor so I have to go buy a new one.
